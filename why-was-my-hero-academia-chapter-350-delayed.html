The vast majority of manga readers will most likely be reading multiple ongoing series at the same time, bouncing between them with each new release.
However, it’s been a while since all of the major manga series released new chapters on the same week or weekend, with Jujutsu Kaisen, One Piece, and Tokyo Revengers all taking untimely hiatuses in recent months."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

This not only allows the team to take well-deserved breaks, but it also allows them to maintain the quality of their writing and illustrations before major events are published.</p><p>Because My Hero Academia was not included in the most recent issue of Weekly Shonen Jump Magazine, Issue number 18, the new chapter was not made available online to international readers.</p><h2>My Hero Academia Chapter 350 Release Date And Time</h2><p>According to the manga series’ page on Viz Media, My Hero Academia chapter 350 will now be released worldwide on Sunday, April 10th.</p><p>According to Manga Plus, the new chapter will be available at the following international times.

While no specific date has been announced, the show is expected to return on one of the two first Saturdays in October, subject to the start of the Fall broadcasting slate and the My Hero Academia program’s usual timeslot in Japan.</p><p>The voice cast for My Hero Academia season 6 has begun to record their dialogue, according to popular My Hero Academia Twitter page ‘Atsushi101X.’ This was later confirmed by the series’ Japanese Twitter page, which also released a special video on the dubbing – sadly, only on Japanese YouTube.</p><p>“Dubbing for the sixth term has already begun.” The sixth period, in which a battle on a grander scale than ever before is fought.
