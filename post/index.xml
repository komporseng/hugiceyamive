これまでに幾度もネットニュースに取り上げられ、特にニコ生時代は他動画サイトにウナちゃんマンのまとめ動画がアップされるなど、凄まじい影響力を持ちました。
そんなウナちゃんマンが、2023年4月5日に死去しました。
今日はウナちゃんマンの死去の詳細について書いてみたいと思います。
ウナちゃんの死因、病死のケースの病名の憶測、亡くなった当時の状況などについて書いてみます。
ウナちゃんマンとは何者？現在までの配信業の実績 ウナちゃんマンはニコ生や”ふわっち”や”ツイキャス”で活躍された配信者です。
近年はYouTubeなども初めており、ユーチューバーの一面もありました。
2000年代初頭からのネット配信の世界にずっといた人物で、ある意味先駆者でもあります。
活動名 ウナちゃん 本名 佐野智則 出身地 静岡県 生年月日 1968年10月29日 最終学歴 国学院久我山高校中退 血液型 O型 職業 配信業。居酒屋。 破天荒で何度も喧嘩＆逮捕。素人配信の先駆者。ニコ生やツイキャス、ふわっちYoutubeで活躍 ウナちゃんマンがネット界に降り立ったのは2000年代の前半でした。
当時はYouTubeも”ふわっち”もない時代で、そんな時代から”yahooチャット”や”スティックカム”などから自分の思ったことを言って共感してもらうような放送をしていました。
今でいうYouTuberの走りのような存在だったのです。
ウナちゃんマンの全盛期は2010年代前後に流行った「ニコニコ生放送」です。
ニコ生にてウナちゃんマンは圧倒的な視聴者数を獲得しており、一時期はネット上の一般人で最も有名な配信者でした。
ヒカキンさんも、シバターさんも、コレコレさんも、米津玄師さんもニコ生時代は当時のウナちゃんマンさんの人気には及びません。
全盛期のウナちゃんマンの放送スタイルはとても過激でした。
他の配信者に喧嘩を売っては放送の中で言い合いをし、時にはリアルに会って面と向かってやり合ったりしていました。
「ニコ生は筋書きのないドラマ」
という名言を残しており、喧嘩ばかりではなく不思議な縁の繋がりや友情も多くあり、”自分も配信をやりたい”と若者に思わせるカリスマ性がありました。
ただ、あまりに過激過ぎるが故に刑事事件になることもあり、実際にウナちゃんマンも配信の中で逮捕されたり、自分自身が警察を呼ばなくてはいけない状況になったりしました。
ニコ生の全盛期にガラの悪い方がドッ押し寄せたのは、間違いなくウナちゃんマンさんの影響でありました。
ニコ生が衰退した後は、ツイキャスなどに活動の場を移し、現在までにYouTubeチャンネルを立ち上げるなど活動を続けていました。
しかし、YouTubeではニコ生時代のような動画は作れず、昔の視聴者が戻ってくることはありませんでした。
一般人がネットで有名になってお金を稼ぐシステムを誰よりも早く構築 ウナちゃんマンがニコ生で活躍していた時代は、現在のYouTuberのようにお金が稼げる時代ではありませんでした。
低収入の生々しさが見えるからこその面白みがあったのかもしれませんが、人気配信者は世間的にいう”社会不適合者”ばかりでした。
そんな時代にウナちゃんマンは自分を支持してくる人からお金をもらったり、視聴者からお酒などを送ってもらうなど、金銭のやり取りを始めました。
”一般人がネットで有名人になってお金を稼ぐ”というスタイルを一番最初に始めたのがウナちゃんマンだと言われています。
挙げ句の果てには自分のSNSに自身の銀行口座を貼り付けるなど、大胆なカンパを行っていました。
月に５０万程度のお金が入る仕組みを作り、毎日家でお酒を飲みながらマイペースに配信をするというスタイルを作り上げました。
一時期、多くの引きこもりやニートなどがニコ生の世界に飛び込みましたが、これらもウナちゃんマンが配信で稼いでいる姿に触発されたからです。
ウナちゃんマンが2023年4月5日に自宅で孤独死。死因は複数？元彼のゲルゲが5月に報告 ウナちゃんマンは2023年4月4日にツイキャスで配信をしていましたが、その後に5月まで音沙汰なし。</description></item><item><title>Appendix:Sword and Shield walkthrough - Bulbapedia, the community-driven Pokmon encyclopedia</title><link>/appendix-sword-and-shield-walkthrough.html</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/appendix-sword-and-shield-walkthrough.html</guid><description>From Bulbapedia, the community-driven Pokémon encyclopedia.
