You just scared the hell out of me! What the hell are you doing? No way…no way!’ the excited dad gushed, obviously very happy to see his child.</p><p>Then Meadow rushes into his arms and they have the sweetest hug.</p><p>As you probably remember, Paul Walker lost his life when the Porsche he was a passenger in crashed into a tree during a fundraiser car show.</p><p>The tragedy happened on November 30, 2013, shocking many.</p><p>In the caption, the daughter wrote: ‘I never thought I’d share this. But it felt right. Be good. I love you. Stay safe. Xx.’</p><p>She was, of course, referring to the current coronavirus, COVID-19 pandemic that has been affecting the whole world.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>While a lot of people are stuck in quarantine for their and others’ sakes, it makes sense Meadow thought a video of her dad laughing uncontrollably would remind them to at least smile as well.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeglsKtedaao6Sdoqh6pa3UoJ%2BtnaJiwKmt0Z6qZqaVq7KzecGenaiqlWLAprHNZquhqp%2Bsr6KvymaapaGgYryneceeqWackZl6ra3UoJ%2BippdirqfAxKtkrKCVYsC2vs%2BroKydo2K1qrmMqKVmq5WpenSElG9ucWc%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
