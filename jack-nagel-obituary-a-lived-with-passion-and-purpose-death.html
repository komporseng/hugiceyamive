Early this morning, he left us peacefully in his sleep, leaving a void in our hearts that seems impossible to fill. As we grapple with the shock of this sudden loss, we find solace in the memories of a man who was not just a father but a pillar of our community for over 40 years. Jack was more than a resident of Sisters; he was a living, breathing embodiment of the spirit that defines this close-knit community. For over four decades, he graced the halls of Apple Jack’s, The Belfry, and The Stand, leaving an indelible mark on the hearts of all who crossed his path. To be greeted by Jack was to be welcomed into a world of infectious warmth, genuine friendship, and hearty laughter.</p><p>In honor of Jack’s memory, we have set up a makeshift altar on the front porch of The Stand. It is a humble tribute to a man who touched the lives of many in ways words can hardly capture. We extend an invitation to each of you, our cherished community members, to visit this memorial. Perhaps you could leave a photo or a token that symbolizes the special connection you shared with Jack. And if you feel inclined, raise a tequila toast to celebrate the vibrant life he led.</p><p>Jack’s celebration of life is in the works, and we will be sharing more details soon. It promises to be a reflection of the joy and vitality that defined his time with us. We hope you can join us to honor a man who gave so much to this community and to each of us individually. As we navigate the complexities of grief, we kindly ask for your understanding and respect for our privacy during these difficult days. The suddenness of this tragedy has left us reeling, and we need the space to come to terms with the reality of a world without Jack’s physical presence.</p><p>To those who have already reached out with messages of love and support, we are profoundly grateful. Your kindness provides a small glimmer of light in these dark moments, and we find strength in knowing that Jack’s impact resonated far beyond our family. Your outpouring of love is a testament to the special place he held in the hearts of many.</p><p>In the coming days, we will share more about Jack’s life, his contributions to the community, and the details of the celebration we are planning in his honor. Until then, let us remember Jack for the joy he brought into our lives, the camaraderie he fostered, and the countless memories that will forever be etched in our hearts. Thank you for being a part of our community, for sharing in our grief, and for honoring the memory of a man who was, and always will be, an integral part of Sisters.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiepaOys63LqJmirKOisq670aKYpWaTpLpwtsCcomamkZyyrXnOm6CtrZGnxm6tjKWgr52UYsSqwMdmp5qro568r3nAp5tmqKWnvbC%2FxGabnpmknXw%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
