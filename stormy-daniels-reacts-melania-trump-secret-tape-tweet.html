It was revealed in early 2018 that the Trump camp made her sign a nondisclosure agreement about the affair prior to the election, and that his personal lawyer, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Michael Cohen</strong></a>, paid her $130,000 for her silence. Before appearing on Cohen’s podcast, Mea Culpa, on October 5, Winston Wolkoff, who worked as a Senior Advisor for Melania Trump and had a leading role in planning some of the inauguration events, shared a tape EXCLUSIVELY with <strong>HollywoodLife</strong> in which Melania discovered that Daniels would be the focus of a photo feature inside Vogue magazine.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>“If you Google, go Google and read it. <strong>Annie Leibovitz</strong> shot the porn hooker, and she’ll be in one of the issues,” Melania tells a confused Winston Wolkoff, who asks her who has been shot in their July 2018 conversation. “Stormy,” Melania clarifies. “Oh, you didn’t read it? Because yesterday it came out. For Vogue! She will be in Vogue. Annie Leibovitz shot her.” Daniels did appear in Vogue‘s August 2018 issue with her lawyer, <strong>Michael Avenatti</strong>. Despite Melania Trump’s claim, there is no evidence that Daniels has ever been a prostitute.</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>Winston Wolkoff explained in an EXCLUSIVE interview with <strong>HollywoodLife</strong> that Melania, who had been featured on the cover of Vogue in her wedding dress in 2005, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>hadn’t been offered</a> one since becoming first lady. And here Daniels, the woman who allegedly slept with her husband was, being shot by one of the most famous fashion photographers of all time. “It was an astonishment,” Winston Wolkoff said.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/stormy-daniels-melania-trump-secret-tape-mega-embed-1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-9>Winston Wolkoff released more secretly recorded remarks from <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>her former friend</a> on Mea Culpa with Michael Cohen. Cohen also spoke to <strong>HollywoodLife</strong> EXCLUSIVELY prior to the October 5 broadcast, praising Winston Wolkoff for her book, which delves deep into her 15-year friendship and working relationship with FLOTUS, which ended in 2018.</p><p id=content-paragraph-10>“She’s the yin to my yang. You can’t really understand the evil of the power of two that’s living in our house, until you understand both,” Cohen, who wrote a tell-all about President Trump called <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Disloyal</a>, said. “What I found most interesting about Stephanie’s book is her interpretation and characterization of Melania,” he continued. “Because my interactions with [Melania], while many, are very different.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpgZH5xe49vZqysn6e6unnDmqWinZyoerOxwJyrrGWdmrmiusiaZK2qpaK9br%2FEnKmerF2prrGxjK2unp2kZA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
