They also must survive a turf war against a ruthless rival gang to break away from the prevalent cycle of addiction and poverty. The series is created by <a href=#><strong>Sterlin Harjo</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Thor: Love and Thunder director Taika Waititi</strong></a>.

Tender-hearted, self-aware, and compassionate, Bear was raised by his mum and longs to reconnect with his estranged dad who now lives in Los Angeles. His craving for a male role model drives him to engage in a comical interaction with a spirit guide who tries to hap his core values.</p><p>Woon-A-Tai had his acting breakthrough as Chase Whaley in Season 1 of the 2018 Family Channel series <strong>Holly Hobbie</strong>. Since then, he has gone on to star as Lucky in <strong>Creeped Out </strong>and Mikey in the Canadian TV crime drama series<strong> Tribal</strong>.

While she may not be one to talk about leadership, she leads by example, the one on whose shoulders the real gravitas for rallying the troops rests. Elora is blessed with a cold resolve that belies her age. After losing her mother at the age of three, she carries the scars of her loss like a badge of honor and is determined to break away from the hold of the Reservation into a better life. This role is played by <strong>Devery Jacobs</strong>, a Mohawk actress who is best known for her performance in the 2013 drama <strong>Rhymes for Young Ghouls </strong>and her role as <a href=#><strong>Sam Black Crow in American Gods</strong></a>.

Her urban native era hats stand her out as the most stylish of the bunch with a personality that brings the much-needed color and panache to an often stoic team. Willie is also the most eccentric of the lot, having a thing for the supernatural when she asks Elora's uncle to put a curse on Jackie. Much of the next season will focus on her family life and the dynamics between her and her father.</p><p>Alexis’s first big gig was a role in <a href=#><strong>Ghostbusters: Afterlife</strong></a>.
