Now, <strong>Justina Machado</strong> is taking on a new role:<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> Dancing With The Stars</a> contestant. Justina, 48, is about to cut a rug on the dance floor and vie for the coveted Mirror Ball trophy on DWTS season 29. Here’s five things you should know about the gifted actress — and dancer! — before her big debut.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3><strong>1. She plays Penelope on One Day at a Time. </strong>Justina plays Penelope on the beloved sitcom, a mother and veteran who suffers from PTSD. <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>One Day at a Time</a> originally aired on Netflix, and moved to Pop TV after massive fan outrage over its cancellation. Justina told <strong>HollywoodLife</strong> EXCLUSIVELY that she was so moved <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>by the fan support</a>. “It’s incredible,” Justina said. “We have a great fan base… It was amazing what they did and we’re so grateful.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-4><strong>2. She was originally known for her roles in dramas, not comedies. </strong>Justina made a name for herself in Six Feet Under, playing Vanessa Diaz, a woman who abused prescription drugs, experienced deep depression, and whose husband cheated on her. On Private Practice, she was a nurse whose heart was broken by <strong>Taye Diggs</strong>‘ character. But she’s also a master at comedic acting, as fans now know.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>“I love going to work and laughing and having a good time, but it’s definitely hard work,” Justina told the <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Chicago Tribune</a> in 2013. “It really is, because you have to figure out where the joke is. Is this the joke? Which word should I hit? It’s liberating, though. As much as I love my dramatic roles, it’s a little tiresome always being the damsel in distress.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/justina-machado-5-things-embed2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-6><strong>3. She’s also a Broadway star. </strong>Justina made her Broadway debut in 2009, playing Daniela in <strong>Lin-Manuel Miranda</strong>‘s Tony-winning musical In The Heights. She went on to star in productions of Love, Loss and What I Wore, Some Girl(s), and Black Butterfly.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7><strong>4. She didn’t think she’d become an actress growing up. </strong>While she loved to sing and perform, Justina thought she’d just get a “normal” job. “My parents are from Puerto Rico. We were lower-middle class,” Justina told the Chicago Tribune. “My family’s mentality was, go and get a good job and stay in Chicago and have a family and just be responsible and just have that real Midwestern kind of life. They just didn’t really think about anything else. Anything like [acting] was not something that was discussed in my house.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/justina-machado-5-things-embed1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-8><strong>5. She’s ready to crush it on Dancing With The Stars. </strong>Justina admitted to <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>ET</a> that she already had a “breakdown” while driving home from <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>rehearsals</a>, and that she’s “gone through every emotion” at this point. As for her first dance? She teased that it’s “in the world of Latin.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme9ahpmaho2K3tr%2FToqWaZZ2WsKmtw6hkbWlpaIVyf44%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
