According to authoritative sources, it has been estimated that Anderson’s net worth is as high as $4 million, an amount earned through her successful career, which started in 2004.</p><h3>Jamie Anderson Net Worth $4 Million</h3><p>Jamie is one of eight children and spent her childhood in her hometown where she was homeschooled, which allowed her more time practicing snowboarding. She took to snowboarding for the first time when she was 10 years old, and since then has become one of the best woman snowboarders. In 2004 she qualified for her first Winter X Games, and the following season won her first medal, a third place in Winter X Games, 15 years of age becoming the youngest ever competitor to win a medal in the event. Since then, Jamie has won five gold medals, in 2007, 2008, 2012, 2013, and most recently in 2017. She also holds five silver medals, which she won in 2010, 2014, 2015, 2016, and 2017, which also increased her net worth to a large degree.</p><p>Aside from Winter X Games, Jamie has competed in the Burton US Open Championships, and TTR World Snowboard Tour, in which she was also quite successful. She became the winner of the 2006-2007 season in Burton Championships slopestyle, and also won the Roxy Chicken Jam emporium in Kaprun, Austria, and the Billabong slopestyle jam, among other events. The following year was even more impressive; she won Women’s Swatch TTR World Snowboard Tour, and the Burton European Open slopestyle and the Roxy Chicken Jam US slopestyle, which only added further to her wealth.</p><p>The following season was marred with injuries, but she still managed to finish third on the Swatch TTR Tour, after winning the Burton New Zealand Open in slopestyle, and halfpipe, then Burton Australian Open in slopestyle, and Nissan X-Trail Nippon Open. She continued successfully, and in 2009-2010 won the Swatch TTR World Tour title. In recent years, she focused more on Winter X Games, and didn’t participate in tours again until 2017, when she finished second in the Burton US Open Snowboarding Championships, which further increased her wealth.</p><p>Also, in 2014 she competed in the Winter Olympic Games, held in Sochi, Russia and won the gold medal in slopestyle.</p><p>Regarding her personal life, Jamie’s most intimate details such as marital status and number of children remain unknown in the media, as she tends to keep such details hidden from the public eyes.</p><p>Jamie is a well-known philanthropist; she has started the Jamie Anderson Foundation in 2013, through which she has helped over 30 young winter sports athletes, by providing clothes, equipment and also financial support. Furthermore, she has participated in the High Cascade Snowboard Camp, and hosted a Signature Session™ at High Cascade, consecutively from 2009 to 2012, and then again in 2014.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<h3 class=toggle-head>Self <span class="fa fa-angle-down" aria-hidden=true></span></h3><table class=self readability=4><tr><th>Title</th><th>Year</th><th>Status</th><th>Character</th></tr><tr><td>The Apprentice</td><td>2015</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Herself - Contestant</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>The Wendy Williams Show</td><td>2015</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Herself - Celebrity Apprentice</td></tr><tr><td>The Line</td><td>2014</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Herself (2014)</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon</td><td>2014</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Herself - Olympic Snowboarder</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Sochi 2014: XXII Olympic Winter Games</td><td>2014</td><td>TV Mini-Series</td><td>Herself</td></tr><tr><td>Vans Cup at Tahoe</td><td>2006</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Herself</td></tr></table><h3>Known for movies</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/networthpost.org/wp-content/themes/net-worth/images/celebrity_net_worth.png><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/movies.networthpost.org/movies/thumbs/2322896_Jamie-Anderson/2322896_The-Apprentice-2015.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/movies.networthpost.org/movie_no_img.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><br><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlanEsL7Toaeoq6RjvLOzjqOYpqGVYq6vsMSrqqimXaOytXnWqKmtoF8%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
