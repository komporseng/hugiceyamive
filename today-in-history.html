Growing up in the forested wilderness, he gained a reputation for hunting. Later in life, he was elected to U.S. Congress, where he was a fierce opponent of the Indian Removal Act of 1830.

While in Arizona, he got on the wrong side of a blacksmith named Frank “Windy” Cahill, who frequently made fun of him. On August 17, 1877, Cahill called Billy a “pimp” and threw the boy to the floor, leading Billy to pull out his pistol and shoot him.</p><h2>1888: James Jameson Dies</h2><p>A 19th-century explorer and heir to the Jameson Irish Whiskey fortune, <a href=# rel=noopener>James Jameson</a> dies of a fever, shortly after he’s implicated in a gruesome incident of cannibalism involving a young enslaved girl.</p><p>While on an expedition to the Congo, Jameson purchased a 10-year-old girl so he could watch her be killed and eaten by cannibals.

Fechter, however, was shot in the pelvis while climbing the wall, and East German guards refused to let anyone provide medical attention. He bled out in front of hundreds of onlookers, and the guards who shot him were found guilty of manslaughter decades later in 1997.</p><h2>1978: First Transatlantic Balloon Flight Takes Place</h2><p>Ben Abruzzo, Maxie Anderson, and Larry Newman become the first people to cross the Atlantic Ocean in a helium-filled balloon.
