So, when news emerged that it was Steve, the Black actor, doing this role on TV, the internet went crazy and leveled racist abuse at Steve.</p><p>But this yet another racist backlash did not faze him though he did have a few things to reflect on the incident. He instead in a way also found it funny that people have not had a problem with flying dragons, but with a Black guy being a nobleman.</p><p>Steve reflected lately to media outlets that despite four weeks of training under his belt, he was not quite ready for the sheer exertion required for the violent beach scenes in the show. It was exhausting he said to play a character that does not carry a sword but a huge, heavy staff.</p><p>Corlys who Steve plays is also known as “The Sea Snake”. He is introduced in the story as the most famed nautical adventurer in the history of Westeros; as someone who even built his house into a powerful seat that is even richer than the Lannisters.</p><h3><strong>Is Steve Toussaint Gay?</strong></h3><p>Steve Toussaint is likely not gay.</p><p>The only thing we know about this is that he is super supportive of gay rights and especially speaks up against violence against gay. But then, he is also as much concerned about human rights/civil rights.</p><h3><strong>Does Steve Toussaint Have A Partner Or A Wife?</strong></h3><p>To put in one sentence answer, Steve Toussaint has not openly admitted to having a partner or a wife out in the public.</p><p>A few times, Steve did mention Simone Kessell as his “wife” in several of his tweets. However, LA-based and working Simone his co-star and onscreen wife in the mini-series, Pine Gap of 2018. He played Ethan James and Simone of course became his wife. Goofing around with her one time like from the set, he wrote on Twitter “OK, so things ain’t great with “the wife” at the moment, but we were happy once… long, long ago! With the fabulous.”</p><p>Auckland, New Zealand-born and raised Simone began pro-acting as a teenager in New Zealand working on local TV dramas and hosting her own kid’s show The Cartoon Company.</p><p>If a serious, romantic in-real-life kind of situation materialized between them, they chose not to tell.</p><p>So, Steve’s relationship status was unclear as of the time of this writing.</p><p>While he prefers to keep his personal life under the carpet, we are at least happy to see him enjoy matrimony on the screen. For instance, lately, what he and Eve Best’s characters have together is labeled as the only relatively healthy relationship in the House of the Dragon.</p><p>Steve’s Lord Corlys Velaryon, on the show, is married to princess Rhaenys Targaryen, a dragon rider who is played by very beloved Eve Best. Before this, Eve notably portrayed Dr. Eleanor O’Hara in the Showtime series Nurse Jackie, First Lady Dolley Madison in the American Experience television special, and Monica Chatwin in the BBC miniseries The Honourable Woman.</p><h3><strong>Steve Toussaint Family</strong></h3><p>All that was understood about Steve Toussaint’s family is that his father worked on the London Underground and his mother was a nurse.</p><h3><strong>Steve Toussaint Height</strong></h3><p>Steve, who is recently seen on the screen sporting white-locs stands 6′ 3″ (1.91 meters). For this role of lord Corlys, he was asked to stop shaving. Despite not being a big fan of the beard, he said he did it anyway because it is part of the look.</p><p>He anyway loved the striking look. He jestingly gushed that even if the show does not do well, he will look good doing his part.</p><h3><strong>How Much Is Steve Toussaint’s Net Worth?</strong></h3><p>Steve Toussaint reportedly had more than $2.5 million net worth as of 2022.</p><p>Many of you may not know this about him: that he is also a very talented writer. For a very long time, he has been whetting his skills by writing blogs on major platforms. Like this one time, he beautifully wrote a story titled “Should I Go or Should I Stay?: The British Black Actors’ Dilemma” highlighting the struggles of being a black actor.</p><p>Anyway, lately as an actor, he is being represented by Third Hill Entertainment in the United States; by Belinda Wright (CDA) in the UK; Johnny Garcia (Rhubarb) looked after his career in voice acting.</p><p>Other than myriads of TV shows (Before We Die, It’s a Sin, In The Long Run, Doctor Who, Deep Water) and movies (Them,&nbsp;England Expects,&nbsp;Doomwatch: Winter Angel), Steve has also been a part of many theatre and screenplays.</p><p>Steve clearly has had a long and circuitous route to acting. While studying politics at the University of Sussex, someone offered him a role in a play and the rest is history.</p><h3><strong>Related FAQs</strong></h3><ul><li><h4><strong>How Old Is Steve Toussaint?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Because Steve Toussaint was born on 22 March 1965, he reached the age of 57 in 2022.</p><ul><li><h4><strong>What Is Steve Toussaint’s Nationality?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Steve Toussaint is British and of Barbadian descent.
