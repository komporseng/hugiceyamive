Russell High School, where he excelled as a leader of the high school football team, ultimately winning the state title in 1992. He received football scholarships from Washington State University and the University of Miami, choosing the former. Ryan continued to dominate on the football field, setting a record of 33 touchdowns in the Pacific 10 Conference and leading Washington to its first Pac-10 championship final in school history.</p><p>His professional football career began in 1998 when he was selected as the second overall pick by the San Diego Chargers. He signed a four-year contract worth as much as $31.25 million and had $11 million in guaranteed money, significantly increasing his net worth.</p><p>However, his form with the Chargers was subpar compared to his college days. He later had stints with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and the Dallas Cowboys before retiring at the age of 26.</p><p></p><p>After retirement, Ryan struggled with drug addiction, leading to a five-year sentence. His net worth has since diminished.</p><p>Prior to his drug problems, Ryan was married to Nicole Lucia from 2001 until 2003, daughter of famous radio personality Ray Lucia.</p><ul class=tabs-menu><li>Structural Info</li><li>Facts</li><li>Filmography</li></ul><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAr7vWp6CgnaKerm%2B6xmipspmeYrmmrcWsZKedpGLEsL7ToWY%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
