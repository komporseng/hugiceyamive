However, his season ended due to a wrist injury in Game 3 of the Eastern Conference Finals. Two seasons after the 1995 finals, however, Anderson’s career took an abrupt downward spiral, largely due to a sudden inability to shoot free throws. During the 1996–97 season, Anderson’s free throw shooting percentage tumbled to a career-low 40.4% and his scoring average to 12.0 points per game. Anderson had to be removed from the closing minutes of several close games due to being an unreliable free throw shooter.</p><h2>Nick Anderson Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Nick Anderson is one of the <strong>richest Basketball Player</strong> from United States.

As a result, the Magic were awarded high draft picks in several consecutive years, including Dennis Scott in 1990, Shaquille O’Neal in 1992, and Chris Webber, who was traded for a package including Penny Hardaway in 1993. In his first few seasons, Anderson was the Magic’s top scoring option, and led the team in points per game during the 1991–92 season. As the team’s talent level increased, Anderson was gradually relegated to a lesser offensive role but remained a consistent member of the team’s starting lineup. Exceptions include the April 23, 1993, game at New Jersey, in which he scored a career-high 50 points off the bench. In 1994–95, Anderson led Orlando in three-pointers with 179, and averaged 15.9 points per game.
