While Alyson had been a cast member since the beginning, Alexis’ character Wesley Wyndham Price didn’t enter the show until the third season. The actress said that they experienced “flirtation at first sight” in a 2012 interview with&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Sun</a>.&nbsp;</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Despite hitting it off, they each had other relationships before they eventually got together in 1999. She dated someone else, because he didn’t want to be involved with someone he worked with, and after he broke up from his relationship, they got together two years later.</p><h2>Alexis Is Also an Actor</h2><p id=content-paragraph-7>As should be clear from their meeting, Alexis is a fellow actor, who is very successful in his own rite. After Buffy, he continued acting in the spinoff series&nbsp;Angel,&nbsp;as Wesley.

She revealed that he began making a beautiful speech as she was mid-bite. “The whole time I am getting kind of frustrated, like, ‘Why does he always do this? He says the most romantic things and it would be the perfect way to propose and then he doesn’t propose,'” she said. “But I knew he meant it because he had a ring.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>The pair said their “I do’s” two years later at an intimate ceremony in Palm Springs. Alyson revealed that she invited her&nbsp;American Pie&nbsp;castmate&nbsp;<strong>January Jones&nbsp;</strong>to the ceremony, and she was the only one. ” It was very small, so a lot of people got nixed. Jason Biggs gave me hell for not being invited,” she told&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Entertainment Weekly.</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-10>The couple renewed their vows 10 years later. Alyson tweeted her husband had an amazing surprise for her. “My hubby @AlexisDenisof surprised me with the most romantic day of my life yesterday! Which included another proposal & ring! I said YES!” she wrote on X (formerly Twitter) in July of that year. The pair had a ceremony to renew their vows that October, per&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>E!
