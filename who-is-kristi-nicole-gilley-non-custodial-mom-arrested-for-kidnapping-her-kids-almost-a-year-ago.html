Brooke Gilley and 12-year-old Adrian Gilley had been missing since March 15, 2022, police said.

"Their non-custodial mother is in custody on parental kidnapping charges out of Clay County, Missouri. Thank you to everyone who shared this post as it helped bring these children home!!!," they added.&nbsp;</p><p>Kristi Gilley has been in the custody of Florida's Alachua County Sheriff's Office since 2.31 pm. on February 2, according to jail documents examined by the publication. The defendant will most likely stay there until she is transferred to Clay County, Missouri, where the arrest warrant was issued, and she will be charged with kidnapping. However, no records as of now are available on how the children were kidnapped.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=split>'Makes me wonder if this is a surrogate mother'</h2><p>"What took so long for someone to share these poor babies were missing, praying they’re found safe," one user reacted on Facebook. Other internet users were speculative saying, "I guarantee this woman is a victim of domestic abuse/coercive control/systemic abuse. Post more information about the father, please." More wrote, "Did you guys also read that the kids were being reunited with their BIRTH family? Since this woman is being called their non-custodial mother, makes me wonder if this is a surrogate case." Others asked, "There are 3 sides to every story, his, her, and the truth. No one will tell the whole truth."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRor5ikeqq%2FjKSpoquknnqvtcKoo55ll565rbHYZqWopl2YwrTAzp2gmqRdoryuecCrqZ6rpJqxbrLOq2SkoZSjrrG8yKeeZqCVp3qstcOsZJqknaTAtXnAZrCemaJirqi7</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
