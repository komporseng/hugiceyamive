There have been many ships that have captured fan imaginations, whether explicitly onscreen or buried deep in hundreds of fanfiction accounts that legally can never see the light of day. There's no two people who haven't been shipped at some point or the other, but a dark horse of ships has just been made canon - long time bar patrons Tommy (Michael Patrick McGill) and Kermit (Jim Hoffmaster)."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

There's no two people who haven't been shipped at some point or the other, but a dark horse of ships has just been made canon - long time bar patrons Tommy (Michael Patrick McGill) and Kermit (Jim Hoffmaster). It's safe to say that nobody was expecting this - but now that it's happened, the fans are in an uproar.</p><p>Under the influence of heavy weed brownies, Tommy and Kermit are sharing a sink in the men's bathroom, washing their faces, when a favorite Phil Collins song of theirs plays 'In the Air Tonight'. Silently, Kermit makes a reach for Tommy's rear and instead of pulling a way, the Tommy slowly leads Kermit into the men's stall of the bathroom, right as Phil Collins croons, "But I've been waiting for this moment, all my life" from the speakers ahead. The two are never actually shown consummating this unexpected attraction, but the implication is very clear - Tommy and Kermit are a thing - or at least they were for a very charged moment.</p><p>The fans are losing their minds, most of them are in too much shock to be able to have an opinion, one way or the other. "Tommy and Kermit I- THIS IS THE BIGGEST PLOT TWIST OF 2020 Iâ€™M CRYING," wrote one fan. "BRUH I CANâ€™T UNSEE THIS &nbsp;not Tommy & Kermit," wrote another. "Why are Tommy and Kermit having sex right now?? What in the world is dis?" wrote a viewer.</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Why are Tommy and Kermit having sex right now?? What in the world is dis? <a href=#>#Shameless</a></p>â€” Tanika ðŸ’™ (@YaGirlJiggy) <a href=#>December 7, 2020</a><p class=end-of-block-quote>&nbsp;</p><p>Other fans are simply&nbsp;thrilled that this is happening, and back this ship 100%. "Kermit & Tommy are headed to be the new #Gallavich ... look out," warns one viewer. "Tommy and Kermit ships are canon now lmao," wrote a fan. "KERMIT & TOMMY BATHROOM BANG??? HERE FOR IT!" wrote this user. Only one fan, so far, is asking the REALLY important question, however - what is the ship name for Tommy and Kermit? "Tommy & Kermit... the unsung heroes of #Shameless since the beginning. So now there will be Tomit stans? Or is Kermy better?" they ask.</p><p>Stay tuned for more stories on the Tommy and Kermit relationship as it develops, on the next episode of 'Shameless'.&nbsp;The next episode of 'Shameless' Season 11 airs December 13 at 9 pm ET, on Showtime.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRoq5iWuqa4xKyqZquVlsCwuoxqaGafkaG5osLInJ9mqpWluaKvxJ1kp52nYsCptc9mmaWnp6h6p63NrGSmoZ6ZwG7AzqaksmWbmr%2ButdNmqqGnp6m2rrE%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
