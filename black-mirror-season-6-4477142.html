The show’s creator is determined to keep audiences on their toes. “I’ve always felt that <i>Black Mirror</i> should feature stories that are entirely distinct from one another, and keep surprising people — and myself — or else what’s the point? It should be a series that can’t be easily defined, and can keep reinventing itself,” Charlie told <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Tudum</a>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-10>He continued, “Partly as a challenge, and partly to keep things fresh for both me and the viewer, I began this season by deliberately upending some of my own core assumptions about what to expect. Consequently, this time, alongside some of the more familiar <i>Black Mirror</i> tropes we’ve also got a few new elements, including some I’ve previously sworn blind the show would never do, to stretch the parameters of what ‘a <i>Black Mirror</i> episode’ even is. The stories are all still tonally <i>Black Mirror</i> through-and-through — but with some crazy swings and more variety than ever before.”</p><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p><p id=content-paragraph-11>Netflix has revealed the episode descriptions for the 5 new episodes.

Over the years, since its 2011 premiere, the series has been met with critical acclaim and massive popularity, which is why it’s been difficult for fans to go without a new episode of Black Mirror since 2019.</p><p id=content-paragraph-23>Currently, there are 22 episodes and one interactive film, titled Black Mirror: Bandersnatch. The episodes all vary in length between 41 and 89 minutes, and they can be watched in any order since they’re all delivered as standalone stories. The actors also rarely appear in more than one episode. However, quite a few episodes make small references to previous episodes through the form of an in-universe news channel or briefly-seen text. All installments of Black Mirror have spanned a variety of genres including drama, political satire, romantic comedy, and psychological horror.</p><h2>Will Black Mirror Season 6 Be The Final Season?</h2><p id=content-paragraph-24>That remains to be seen. In an interview with the <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Radio Times</a> in May 2020, series creator <strong>Charlie Brooker</strong> admitted that he had put writing new episodes of Black Mirror on pause amid the COVID-19 pandemic. “At the moment, I don’t know what stomach there would be for stories about societies falling apart, so I’m not working away on one of those. I’m sort of keen to revisit my comic skill set, so I’ve been writing scripts aimed at making myself laugh,” he revealed.</p><p id=content-paragraph-25>Furthermore, there’s been a potential issue with the rights to the show. In January 2020, Charlie Brooker and <strong>Annabel Jones</strong> — the showrunners of Black Mirror — revealed that they were departing the show’s production company, Endemol Shine Group. The rights to the show currently remain with that production company. And since then, Charlie and Annabel created a new production company called Broke & Bones, which has a deal with Netflix for other projects. Broke & Bones is the official production company for season 6.</p><p id=content-paragraph-26>On a positive note, however, Banijay Group purchased Endemol in 2019, and <strong>Cathy</strong> <strong>Payne</strong>, who is the head of Banijay’s distribution department, told <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Variety</a> that season 6 of Black Mirror could still happen — and now that has come to fruition. Banijay Rights is licensing the show.</p><p id=content-paragraph-27>Bandersnatch is actually the reason why season 5 was so short. According to an interview with <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Digital Spy</a>, Charlie said, “Originally, Bandersnatch was part of season 5. So ‘Striking Vipers,’ we actually shot before we started shooting Bandersnatch. ‘Smithereens,’ a little bit of that overlapped with Bandersnatch. … But then as we worked on it more, it became apparent that Bandersnatch was the equivalent of doing a whole season in itself.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme8GlmJyjXaK2s77Oq2SsnZGovK95lWZrbW9nZoFzew%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
