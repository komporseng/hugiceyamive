On February 20, the star looked fresh-faced while attending the 71st NBA All-Star game in Cleveland, Ohio, with her fiance, Machine Gun Kelly. Her less-is-more approach to beauty is definitely a vibe, and her fit figure at 35 is evidence that a healthy lifestyle is key to fighting the effects of aging.</p><p>So, how does this A-lister maintain her radiant skin and energy amid her busy lifestyle? We’ve snagged Megan Fox’s anti-aging secrets so that you can rock a healthy, no-fuss glow too.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.eatthis.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2022/02/megan-fox-black-outfit.jpg><p>Megan Fox flaunts a glassy glow thanks to her belief in short showers and frequent facial cleansings. Keeping her complexion clean is necessary to prevent clogged pores and textural issues. As far as showers go, she keeps it short and simple. Hot, longer showers produce dry skin by removing natural oils, so keeping the water lukewarm instead is important. The American Academy of Dermatology recommends limiting your bath and shower time to five to ten minutes to help heal and prevent dry skin. It sounds like Megan may be on to something.</p><p>Related: Things a Hot Bath Does For Your Body</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.eatthis.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2021/08/whole-foods-grapeseed-oil.jpg><p>Megan lives by the mantra, ‘”less is more,” and she incorporates that into her beauty routine as well. Simple, highly effective anti-aging treatments are her go-to’s, and moisturizers are no exception. She has been known to use rose oil for its deep hydrating and luxuriously scented qualities. Fox also favors organic grapeseed oil for soothing and smoothing her radiant complexion, she told The Huffington Post. When used topically, grapeseed oil provides the skin with powerful antioxidants and anti-aging benefits. It’s packed with beta-carotene and vitamins C, D, and E, which protect your skin from environmental aggressors. Megan loves the lightweight, non-greasy feel of grapeseed oil, a potent anti-aging must-have in her beauty arsenal.<span aria-hidden=true>6254a4d1642c605c54bf1cab17d50f1e</span></p><p>Related: 22 Foods To Eat When You Have Dry Skin</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.eatthis.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2022/02/megan-fox-naked-dress.jpg><p>Megan Fox pampers her baby blues using eye serum formulated with vitamin C.
