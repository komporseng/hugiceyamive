We’re not sure yet, but one of the judges hinted that Huntley Lenderman could win The Voice. Team Niall’s Huntley and Brailey Lenderman sang an electric rendition of Hootie & the Blowfish’s “Hold My Hand.” The battle round performance got all four judges out of their seats.</p><p>“I think y’all did a wonderful job,” McEntire told the brother-sister duo. “It kind of made me a little envious that I didn’t get to be up there singing with you.” However, McEntire signaled Huntley out as a “force of nature on stage,” a sentiment that continued with all of the coaches.</p><p>“Brailey, you were powerful,” Legend also said in the clip. “The problem is, you were against Huntley. The magnetism and the energy that you convey is just very attractive and it connects people to you… Dude, you’re great.”</p><p>“I was just not expecting that!” Stefani said, adding “Huntley, I’m worried that you might win this show… Your precision and perfection of how you did, it’s hard to believe.”</p><p>Finally, the siblings’ coach Niall Horan praised Huntley’s stage presence. “It’s just insane to watch you prowl around that stage while singing that well.” He also told Brailey that she was “absolutely on fire up there.”</p><p>Huntley shared the <a href=# rel=nofollow>performance on Instagram</a>, and fans flooded the singer’s comments with acclaim. “Huntley is hands down the BEST not only this season but The Voice history to date in my opinion,” one user wrote. Meanwhile, another fan suggested that he should leave the competition and receive a record deal right away. “They need to just take you out of the competition and give you a record deal… your voice is amazing and you deserve this.”</p><p>For the 33-year-old’s blind audition, he sang “She Talks to Angels” by The Black Crowes. “You sing your own way. You sing very direct, and [with] so much power,” Horan <a href=# rel=nofollow>said</a> to Huntley. “The control that you have, it’s so beautiful to listen to. You made us feel, and that’s a really important thing.”</p><p>Watch the clip of Huntley and Brailey Lenderman’s performance, below.</p><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p><p>Tune in Monday at 8 p.m. on NBC to see who wins!</p><p><strong>For more on&nbsp;The Voice, check out our gallery <a href=#>of the The Voice&nbsp;Season 24 cast ahead of the competition’s finale</a>.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirn5a9tHrSoZykpp%2BswG%2BvzqZmrKeRpcBwusSwqmhuaWyBcXyOrZ%2BeZaaktqSxjLCgp6aVp3pzfJFsZKmqlZm2pMDIqKVo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
