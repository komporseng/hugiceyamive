We had a 28-piece live orchestra, we had 12 dancers, we had two guest stars a week and Bob Mackie designed—get this—60 to 75 costumes a week, everything everybody wore in all the sketches and all the musical numbers, on and on and on.”</p><p>She continued, “And no network today would spend that kind of money. The money that it would cost today would be astronomical. So, they’re not gonna go for it. And they, you know, they feel that variety is dead, which I don’t believe it is. … There are many people who could do a variety show, but … they couldn’t do what we did because of the cost. That’s the problem. That’s why there aren’t any shows like ours or Dean Martin or any of those, you know, just can’t happen today.”</p><a href=# rel=dofollow class=u186c9b438816a13d3cb7369504da2251><span class=ctaText>ALSO READ</span>&nbsp; <span class=postTitle>Meet Carol Burnett's Three Daughters: Carrie, Jody, and Erin</span></a><h3>All you need to know about Carol Burnett’s early life</h3><p>Carol Creighton Burnett came into the world on April 26, 1933.
