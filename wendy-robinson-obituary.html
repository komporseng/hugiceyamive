We were all so proud of her! Imagine our surprise when we arrived at the venue in Indianapolis and were wearing the same dress!”</p><p>Howard Stevenson, “I’m sad to hear of the passing of Dr. Wendy Robinson. She spent a total of 47 years as an educator with Ft.Wayne Community Schools.”</p><p>T.R. Snider posted, “So very sorry to hear about Wendy Robinson passing away. I coached Jason and my heart goes out to him and the entire family.”</p><p>Robinson was a pioneer since she was the first graduate woman to hold the position of district superintendent in FWCS. Robinson attended DePauw University after completing his high school education at Central. Robinson went on to receive a doctorate from Ball State University, two master’s degrees from Purdue Fort Wayne (then known as IPFW) and other degrees.</p><p>Robinson was selected Indiana’s Superintendent of the Year among many other honours in 2018. Robinson said <a href=# rel=noopener>in an interview</a>:</p><p>“I don’t see this as something for me. I see it as a recognition of the work that happens in this district every single day. And that makes it more important that people recognize there are great things happening in the district because of the people in it.”</p><p>Involved in the neighborhood, Robinson served on many boards including Parkview Health and Learning Forward. The Family and Community Engagement Center for the school district, which Robinson assisted in establishing in 2016, was called in her honor in 2022.</p><p><strong>If you want to read the obituaries of other persons then you can check out our below posts:</strong></p><p>Our deep condolences are with her family and friends.
