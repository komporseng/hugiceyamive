In 2015, Bosh experienced blood clotting in his lung, a condition that forced him to miss the latter part of the 2014-2015 NBA season. Despite his efforts to return to the court, the issue persisted, and in 2016, Bosh failed his preseason physical due to concerns related to blood clotting. This led the Miami Heat, Bosh's team at the time, to declare that he was unable to play basketball due to medical reasons. The potential risks associated with his condition, particularly the threat of life-threatening complications, ultimately led to Bosh's retirement from the NBA.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>Impact on Team Dynamics</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>Bosh's health concerns not only affected his personal career but also had significant implications for the teams he played for.
