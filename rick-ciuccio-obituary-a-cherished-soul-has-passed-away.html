When he came yesterday morning, it was six minutes and eight seconds before the hour. My husband, who was not only fantastic and amazing but also my love, passed away unexpectedly, and it came as a shock to me. He was both lovely and amazing. In each of these roles, he was an excellent individual, including being an outstanding life partner, parent, grandfather, brother, friend, uncle, nephew, cousin, and neighbour. He was also an exceptional individual outside of these responsibilities.</p><p>To add insult to injury, he was a wonderful person despite all of these challenges. In addition to that, he was a wonderful companion during his entire life. There are a lot of individuals who are going to miss Rick because of his contagious smile, his enthusiasm for music, and his extensive range of trivia knowledge. There is going to be a shortage of each and every one of these options. Being in his presence was the most important thing in my life. By his side, I was centred. I am currently having a void in my heart. I am feeling this void. The fact that a guardian angel was there in paradise the day before was, without a doubt, a blessing for the highest realm.</p><p>Following the funeral services that are scheduled to take place in Kutztown on the following Thursday, there will be a visitation at the Ludwig funeral home from ten to twelve o’clock on the following Thursday. The visitation will take place after the funeral services. The service will begin at twelve o’clock, and it will continue till the hour. We will continue with the service. The dissemination of more information is planned to take place at a later time after the event has already taken place. I would like to officially introduce myself; my name is Sharon.</p>0<span class=mashsb-sharetext>SHARES</span><a class="mashicon-facebook mash-large mash-center mashsb-noshadow" href=# rel=nofollow><span class=icon></span><span class=text>Share</span></a><a class="mashicon-twitter mash-large mash-center mashsb-noshadow" href=# rel=nofollow><span class=icon></span><span class=text>Tweet</span></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmihnqG8t7XNoKSepZ%2Bntqa%2FzZ6urGaTpLpwvsicomabmaqwpLXOZqaboaSqrrPFjJpknKCVp7a0tMSdZKynpaF6qa3SZqeaq6OasW6t1pqwaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
