She was born on December 1, 1970 in Bedford, New Hampshire. Her mother is Beth Ann, and her father is Donald. She grew up in New Hampshire where her mother was a photographer and the founder of the New Thalian Players, a theater company. Her father was a retail associate as well as a trained social worker. Their marriage did not last and both decided to remarry after their divorce was finalized. She has five siblings, of which Sarah Silverman is the youngest. She is not religious, though her family is very Jewish. Her entire life she wanted to be a stand-up comedian, and she began to fulfil her dreams when she was only 17.</p><p>It was at that age she performed for the first time in Boston, and she says that it was awful and she was no good. She decided at that point that college might be the best bet for her, so she attended NYU for one year before realizing that it simply did not fit into her dream of really becoming a comic. That’s when she decided to get back into comedy in Greenwich Village. She began comedy in 1992 and by 1993 she was performing on Saturday Night Live. It’s safe to say that this is not a small feat and that she was already quite accomplished to have found a role on this particular show so early into her career.</p><p>She became famous very fast her for comedy, but it was in 2007 when she was given her own show “The Sarah Silverman Program,” that people really began to take note of her humor. Fast and funny, she gained a lot of followers and fans and she’s never looked back on her career before that. Her career has been really amazing, and she’s been part of so many projects that she cannot even remember them all. Throughout her rise to fame, though, she’s managed to keep her private life as private as possible. She is a full on vegetarian, and has been since she was 10. She suffers from clinical depression, but she’s never been shy about talking about it, taking a stand for those who might be ashamed of their own diagnosis of the same disease.</p><p>She’s been addicted to prescription drugs, she’s a lifelong bed-wetter, and she does not want kids of her own because she is afraid that they might inherit her depression. However, she is very open to having kids that are not biologically her own. Sarah Silverman and comedian Jimmy Kimmel were in a six-year relationship in the early 2000s, but they remain friendly with one another even though their relationship did not work and he is now a married man with kids of his own. Her career is impressive, and it is only beginning to get more impressive as time goes on, raising her net worth and making her more famous.</p><p>Photo by Getty Images</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCtp5%2BXe6S7zGiqmqqRnXq0tcuvnKulkaN6r7HTZq6oqqSdfA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
